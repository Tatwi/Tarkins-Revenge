# My Contributions

This repository is an archive of my contributions to the Tarkin's Revenge project. The project was moved from [GitHub](https://github.com/TarkinII/Tarkins-Revenge) to [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/tarkinsrevenge/tarkins-revenge/src/master/) in fall 2019. **Since that time the GitHub repo for Tarkin's Revenge has been reset to a point before any of the commits I made are listed, thereby erasing the pull request and commit history from GitHub.** However, all of the code changes I worked on and submitted over the years are listed here in the various update/feature branches within this repo and the code can still be seen in their codebase on BitBucket as of October 2020.

I spent many hundreds of hours programming, testing, researching, learning, and openly sharing my knowledge for various Tarkin related projects between 2014 to 2020, because I wanted to be helpful. And, I was. :)
